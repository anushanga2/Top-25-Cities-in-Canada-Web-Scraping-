# Top-25-Cities-Canada-2023  (Web Scraping)
* This document lists the top 25 cities by population in Canada.  
* Web scraping data extraction technique allowed me to efficiently automate the data collection process and save the data to a .csv file.
* Web scraping tools used here are BeautifulSoup in Python to extract the data from selected websites. The web scraping technique was tailored to the nature of the data source.
* After extracting data, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency.
* Then, a Tablaeu dashboard was created to display the results of web scraped data.
